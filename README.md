# chaiNNer-nightly

This repository is simply for building and hosting nightly releases of [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer) that are separate from the main repository.

Nightly releases are built every day at 23:00 UTC, regardless of if there are any new changes.

If you want to stay up-to-date and beta test features before release, simply download a build from here.

Keep in mind, these builds are potentially unstable. Use at your own risk.
